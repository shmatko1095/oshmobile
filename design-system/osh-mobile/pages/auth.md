# Auth Page Overrides

Use `MASTER.md` as base. This file defines only auth-specific adjustments.

## Layout

- Centered single-column form.
- Content horizontal padding: `24`.
- Vertical rhythm between fields/buttons: `16-24`.

## Visual Rules

- Use shared dark filled field style.
- Primary and secondary auth actions share same geometry (height/radius).
- Link color uses accent token only; no custom ad-hoc blues.

## Interaction

- Loading state keeps button size stable.
- Password visibility icon follows shared icon color tokens.

## Keep As-Is

- Existing flow and form order.
- Existing validation logic and bloc events.
